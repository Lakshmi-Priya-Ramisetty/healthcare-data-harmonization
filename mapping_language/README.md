# Google HCLS Whistle Data Transformation Language

## Summary

This defines a syntax designed to express mappings of data from one structure to
another.

This syntax is transpiled into a configuration file for the
[Data Harmonization Mapping Engine](http://github.com/Lakshmi-Priya-Ramisetty/healthcare-data-harmonization/blob/master/mapping_engine)
which can then execute the mappings.

The engine accepts data in JSON format and outputs it in JSON format.
For information on the syntax, look at the included documents in the docs
folder.

## Building and Testing

### TL;DR

Run `build.sh`

### Details

This project is a go module. It can be built and tested with `go build` and
`go test`.

There is an additional go module in the test directory, which runs some
integration tests using the mapping engine.

The `whistle_*.go` files in the parser directory are generated by [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/).
If you modify the grammar (`Whistle.g4`) file make sure to re-run
`generate_grammar.sh` or `build.sh`.
